      A flex bracelet is stainless steel wrapped in a precious metal such as rose/yellow/white metals.  They are a great alternative to the Tennis Bracelet because it does not change shape, and offers a beautiful mix between that and the bangle.  They are also the easiest to put on, as the wearer does not need to push their hand through, rather cuff onto the wrist.
