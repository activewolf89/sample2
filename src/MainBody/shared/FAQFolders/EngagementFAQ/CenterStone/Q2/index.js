      Man-made diamonds have been the center of recent controversy in the jewelry world, where there are pros and cons for each side that can delve deeper than this paragraph.  In general, man-made diamonds can be considered structurally the same as a natural diamond, and can be differentiated with proper lab equipment.  Man-made diamonds will continue to drop in price, which makes it a poor investment in the time-being, but if the intent is to not sell the diamond back then may be an alternative which we can provide examples with.  Natural diamonds traditionally have maintained value over long periods of time and are millions of years old.
