      There are plenty of different styles to consider from solitaire being one center-stone with a plain-band or diamonds, to a halo(with small diamonds around the center-stone in certain sizes).  Any engagement ring being considered should be seen with what a potential wedding band would look like in order for the two bands to blend as best as possible.   The best step towards finding the style is just to look through the rings/pictures you have and see what would work best.'
