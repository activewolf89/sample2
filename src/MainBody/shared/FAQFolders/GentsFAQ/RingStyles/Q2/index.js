      Matching the bands together can be done subtely such as inside engraving, or more visually such as the exact
      band but different widths.  We represent a few designers such as Tacori, who create a matching effect where the ladies bands
      and gent's bands carry the same side-profile design of crescents allowing for a beautiful match.
