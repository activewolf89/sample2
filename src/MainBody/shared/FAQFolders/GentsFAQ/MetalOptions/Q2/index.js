      White-metals come in three different shades, from whitest to darker gray â€“ platinum, white-gold, and palladium.  Platinum is the whitest of the metals, is used quite a bit in engagement rings and diamond bands due to casting and softness and is the heaviest weight.  White-gold is often a warmer yellow/white color, medium weight, and is the hardest of the white-metals.   Palladium is the darkest gray, the lightest weight, and is softer than white-gold.
