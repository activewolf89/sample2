      Carat weight is often misunderstood with size of stone, mainly because it is a unit of weight, however the
      weight may be more on the bottom of the stone vs. weight more spread out.  For example, a one-carat Asscher-cut 
      may be about 20% smaller in appearance than a Cushion-shaped stone, because more of the carat-weight is on the top of the profile.
      The carat weight should be taken in special consideration with knowing how the stone is cut, rather than just own its own.
