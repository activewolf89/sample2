      Hoop earrings can be done with diamonds/gemstones or plain.  We recommend positioning any earring in a position to allow a natural lay on the ear, and can adjust the post accordingly.  A hoop can be done also with diamonds on the other side of the hoop, allowing maximal exposure to the sparkle.
