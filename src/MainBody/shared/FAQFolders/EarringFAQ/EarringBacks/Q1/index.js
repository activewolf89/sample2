      While earring backs vary from metal alloy, to design, we suggest a simple jumbo-back ear-nut that is typically done in 14K gold.  The reason we suggest this is due to ease of use putting on and strength of tension on the post.  If you ever feel that the earring back is getting loose, we can tighten it at the store or you can tighten it yourself with needle-nose pliers on the two loops in the back.
