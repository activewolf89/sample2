      A FireCushion is the branded Cushion-cut we carry to maximum light return that rivals that of the round brilliant-cut.  The cushion-shaped diamond is cut with a round brilliant-cut like pavilion, which maximizes caret-weight, and high crown-angles which maximum light return.  In Essence, the wearer gets a larger-looking stone and a brighter one.
