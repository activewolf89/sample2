      Jewelry should never be worn in water, at the gym, or anything involving physical labor such as cleaning or doing dishes.  The reason for this is, the pieces are not indestructible and especially rings, will lose to whatever it hits.  It is best to keep jewelry in a designated area away from harm, we offer jewelry ring-holders to our clients and are happy to check the pieces/clean anytime.
