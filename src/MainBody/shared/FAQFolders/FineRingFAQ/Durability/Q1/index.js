      If the ring has more diamonds on the band than metal, we often recommend if going white, platinum.  It is a softer material, but possesses properties that will hold diamonds together best, and reduce the chance of any prongs from wearing away over time.  If the ring is more metal, we prefer working with gold, as it is more scratch resistant than platinum.
