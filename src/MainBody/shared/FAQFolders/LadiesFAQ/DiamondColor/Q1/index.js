      What is the color range?
      The color of a diamond is typically based off the amount of Nitrogen in the stone and casts a yellow tint to the stone.  GIA standardized the color spectrum of D – Z we use today, and ranges from colorless D – F, near colorless G – I, and onwards down to intense and fancy yellows.  We primarily try to stick within the F – J range when looking at engagement ring quality diamonds and warmer colors for accent stones such as studs.
