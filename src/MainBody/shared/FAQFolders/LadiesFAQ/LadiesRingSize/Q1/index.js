      We measure your finger with a ladies ring-sizer that is about 2-3MM wide.  We will check to see if you’re finger is consistent or if you’re hands are running hot/cold for the day, find the tightest part of the finger, either the knuckle or the back of the finger depending on the person. The average ring-size is between a size 5-7, and any ring can be ordered in the size that best fits the finger.
