      While this remains purely a case-by-case basis, a few questions may be asked in order to determine what works best for your life-style.  Automatics in their own right are magnificent works of art due to the fact that they require much more tiny, intricate and even gemstone pieces that act as frictionless parts to keep the movement in your watch lasting as long as possible.  If you always will wear your watch and like the idea of purely the energy of your movement, an automatic may be right for you.  If you decide on a quartz watch, you do not have to change the time when not wearing the watch, and is often an easier option for those who just want a hands-off approach to their watch needs, no winding is required.
