      Leather straps will wear lighter, and break into the wearerâ€™s natural wrist curvature.  Over-time due to the wear-n-tear of this material, it may not last as long as the metal bracelet.  The metal bracelet can hold the test of time longer, however it remains heavier, and a completely different look than the leather strap.
