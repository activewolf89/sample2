      Diamonds do not sparkle on their own, they require precise cutting, separate from the need to maximize the actual carat size of the stone.
      The cut may be the hardest component to decipher between the different C's, mainly because it takes knowledge of cut angles and what shape
      the stone itself will eventually be cut into.  We specialize in the cut factor, and walk through our customers as much as possible to explain why
      certain stones sparkle more than others.
