      We recommend a company called Jewelers Mutual, they are what we insure our jewelry with, and provides an easy way to get quickly covered.  We like Jewelers Mutual because they cover often overlooked but important scenarios such as “mysterious disappearance” or if the stone is lost completely they will give you credit to get the piece replaced.
