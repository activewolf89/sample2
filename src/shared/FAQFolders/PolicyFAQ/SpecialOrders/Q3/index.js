      Any piece bought from stock, and never worn such as a presentational gift, can be returned for a full refund or store credit towards another piece.  99% of our customers who purchase from us typically do not need to return any pieces, since we guide the customer carefully through the buying process, but if we need to return on a stock piece we will be more than happy to facilitate that.
