      Stone cutters often have to decide between a number of factors between cutting for the stone size,
      cutting for sparkle, knowing where to cut in order to enhance color or reduce clarity.  Stones may be cut
      heavier, while sacrificing the actual stone sparkle which again is why cut has to be taken into consideration with carat.
