      Jewelry insurance goes together with the appraisal, as the value of the piece should be covered by the appraisal value.  We do not sell insurance, but recommend a company called Jewelers Mutual for this; they only ensure jewelry, is a standard for the industry, and will cover topics such as mysterious disappearance, theft, and damage.  If anything does happen to your piece, the best thing to do would be to contact us first, and we will guide you in your decision-making process; many times, damage to the piece can be fixed in-house without calling insurance.
