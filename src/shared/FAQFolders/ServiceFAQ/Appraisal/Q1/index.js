      We can do appraisals on pieces that are from us directly.  The reason for this is, we know exactly where the origins of these pieces are, the costs involved, and if anything does happen, we can reorder or recreate the piece.  Please email us an appraisal request and we will do our best to get a quote and see if our appraiser can meet the request.
