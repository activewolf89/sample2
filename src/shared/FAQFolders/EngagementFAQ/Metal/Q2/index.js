      White-gold is yellow mixed with a white metal and plated to make it whiter with Rhodium.  The rhodium over time(mainly the bottom of the ring) wears away over-time and the yellow of the metal starts to show through.  White-gold is a hard material, meaning it will show less scratches but will also have to be re-tipped for prongs because the metal wears away the tiny prongs that hold the stones.  Platinum is a natural element on the periodic table, it does not change color, and holds diamonds and gemstones the best out of any metal.  That being said, we typically suggest platinum if possible on all engagement rings.
