      The primary focus is to have the exact ring-size without spoiling the surprise. This ends up being a challenge in itself mainly due to the fact that there are a number of different fingers that one ring may be worn on, but generally when looking at a finger-size we look at the largest part of the finger first -- which will be most likely either the beginning of the knuckle or the end of the finger. A general rule of thumb is to try on a ring, and closely compare that with your own finger, and using this we can find the ring-size. Generally you would want to be a little bigger than smaller as the purpose is to wear the ring as a surprise and then can be sized down afterwards'
