      The easiest and safest way to propose is with a simple solitaire setting, set with a diamond from us â€“ we charge $150 for a 14K simple solitaire and set it with any diamond you select from us.  Once you propose, you can leave the ring as-is and it would last a life-time, or we can take the stone out of the center and set it into a more permanent mounting and credit you back the amount.
