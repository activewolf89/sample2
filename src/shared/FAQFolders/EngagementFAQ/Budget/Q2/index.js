      The budget is often the driving force behind many conscious or unconscious design-making we do when making our purchase – what is the style the wearer would like, and how can I achieve this style in the least expensive way possible seem to go hand-in-hand.  We at L T Denny Jewelers do our best to respect the budget of the buyer, however expectations are made, and if the budget and the overall look may have to be re-alligned from time-to-time.  The largest portion of the budget ends up being primarily the diamond, and in today’s day-and-age information is so readily available along with certs that the end-buy may get confused or overlook something that a professional may see, and question why one stone is more or less expensive than another; there is a reason why diamond are priced they way they are and will take the time to educate as much as possible for the buyer to make an informed decision.'
